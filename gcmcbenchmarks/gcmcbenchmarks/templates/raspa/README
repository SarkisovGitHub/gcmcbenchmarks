RASPA Simulation notes
----------------------


Simulations were performed using version 2.0 of Raspa


Raspa allows a grid to be used to calculate fluid-framework interactions.
The input files to generate this grid are in the XXXXX directory.
Benchmarks were performed with and without this grid.


Cycles vs Steps
---------------

Benchmarks were done for a given number of Monte Carlo moves,
however Raspa measures simulations in terms of Cycles.
A Cycle consists of a move for every molecule in the system.

To simulate an identical number of moves then.. the number of cycles
changes depending on the number of molecules (known a priori).
